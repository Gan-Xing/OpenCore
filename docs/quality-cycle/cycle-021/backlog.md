# cycle-021 Capability Map Productization Backlog

Started: 2026-06-12

## State Alignment

- [x] Re-read cycle-020 backlog, completion report, ledger and quality-cycle
      state.
- [x] Align `.opencore/quality-cycle/state.json` from documented cycle-020
      completion to active cycle-021 state.
- [x] Record cycle-021 as capability-map productization, not a continuation of
      the BE20 backend self-loop prompt.

## Round 1: core.notice Productization

Why this slice: RuoYi and Yudao both expose system notice management as a
first-class System capability. OpenCore already has the backend package/API
runtime, but SDK/Admin route/access/menu/smoke coverage is incomplete. This is
the lowest-dependency product gap before department/post hardening.

- [x] Add missing detail API contract for system notices.
- [x] Extend `@opencore/sdk` with typed system notice client methods, query
      filters and fixtures.
- [x] Promote `core.notice` to an Admin route/access/menu-checked module.
- [x] Add a live Admin System Notices page with list/detail/current-page export
      plus create/update/publish/archive/delete actions.
- [x] Extend Admin smoke checks to lock the notice route, access binding and SDK
      usage.
- [x] Refresh OpenAPI snapshot and registry route/tag checks.
- [x] Run focused and full gates.
- [x] Commit and push this independently accepted product slice.

## Explicitly Out Of Scope

- Notice read/unread inbox, header badge and per-user read tracking.
- Message bus push, WebSocket delivery or mail/SMS fan-out.
- BPMN/workflow approval around announcements.
- Tenant-scoped notices.
- CRM/ERP/MES/WMS/mall/member/pay/AI modules.
